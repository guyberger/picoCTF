Steps:

1. connect to remote shell and download the .json file. I use tmux to split screen so i can view/work with the file while also being on the shell.

2. to gather all the required informaton you can either: 
	-read the file and gather data.
	-use bash commands to find info quickly. Yeah lets do this one.

3. to find the most popular src_ip: 
	'cat incidents.json | grep src_ip | sort | uniq -c

4. to find the file info:
	'cat incidents.json | grep file | sort | uniq -c
