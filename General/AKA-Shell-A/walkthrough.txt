There are few bugs with the server but overall this was a nice touch.

Steps:

1. after connecting to the remote shell we are welcomed and are being told to "hurry up" before system will shut down. They are not joking it shuts down...
	first things first we can use 'ls' to see what we are dealing with.

2. going through the folders we allowed to see, we can go into the folder 'secret' to find some intel files we need to delete, using 'rm intel_*' to delete all of them.

3. next we are instructed to move to executables folder and then run the script there.

4. we are asked to print the current user name which can be done using the bash command 'whoami'.

5. finally there is a hidden folder apparently called tmp. we move to the root folder and 'mv /tmp/TopSecret passwords'.

6. reed TopSecret from passwords folder to get the flag.
