Steps:

1. To convert a base10 number to base2 we can use python again with the command 'bin(27)'.
	notice this will result in '0b11011'. 

2. We need to string the '0b' which signifies the binary base for the flag. To do this we can use the slicing function of python:
	'0b11011'[2:] ==> '11011'	#slices from the third index of the string to the end.	


PROTIP: to make the answer shorter, we can use a bash and python command line which does the same:

	echo "${python -c "print(bin(27)[2:]"}"	==> '11011'
