This time we overflowing the password field will get us no where since the code puts 
'0' in the end of the input correct size and so strcmp is not gonna return 0 unless we know the password...

However, the function fgets of 'name' is not used securely, we can overflow 'name' buffer to run over the 'password'
buffer. Afterwards the code writes out the actual password to the password buffer and the function puts writes out
the fake name we put => however, the length of the name is long enough to cover also the bytes of the password buffer.

Since we overridden the 'password' buffer before the program put the actual password on it, when puts is called 
it's going to print the password aswell.

Steps:

1. Insert ~320 chars of 'a' (could be anything really...) as a name to reveal the password.

2. nc again and insert the password to reveal the flag.
