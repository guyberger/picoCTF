Steps:

1. Opening the .c file we see that we should try to reach win().

2. To do so we overflow the buffer to run over the original return address.

3. By trying some inputs we discover that the 4 bytes after 44 regular chars ('a' for example)
	will start to run over the return address.

4. To get win's address we can use either pwn package or using gdb: 'info address win".

5. To get the flag: python -c "from pwn import *; print 'a' * 44 + '\xcb\x85\x04\x08'" | ./vuln
