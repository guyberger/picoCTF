Steps:

1. Download the program using wget.

2. Notice we don't have permission to run the file './run'. To add executable permission we use the command "chmod +x run".

3. Run the file to get the flag: "./run".

Note: on 64-bit Linux you will need to add i386 architecture since 'run' is a 32-bit executable.
