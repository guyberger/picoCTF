Guidelines:

1. In this excercise we get a program that mentions we need a faster computer.
Using IDA we see that there is a function called set_timer which sets a stop clock for 
1 second or so and when the clock ends the signal activates an alarm which causes the program to
exit. To bypass that we can either: patch the file and remove the function/ bypass using GDB.

Steps:

1. Using gdb we set a breakpoint just before the function call to 'set_timer'.

2. Then we can simply set the pc register to the command just after the call so 
	that we dont perform the function (it is possible since the function has no effect on the actual code
	except for exiting) - 'set $rip = <address of next instruction>'

3. conitnue execution using gdb to get the flag.
